= Testing Ratpack Applications
Dan Hyun <@LSpacewalker>

Ratpack is a developer friendly and productivity focused web framework.
That's quite a claim to make.
We'll explore how Ratpack's rich testing facilities strongly support this statement.

== Intro

* Test framework Agnostic (Spock, JUnit, TestNG)
* Core fixutres in Java 8+, first-class Groovy Support available
* Most fixtures implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable`
** Need to either close yourself or use in `try-with-resources`
** Provides points of interaction that utilize an execute around pattern in cases where you need the fixture once.

=== `GroovyRequestFixture`

==== Testing Standalone Handlers

[source, groovy]
.ImportantHandler.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/main/groovy/ImportantHandler.groovy[]
----

[source, groovy]
.ratpack.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/ratpack/ratpack.groovy[]
----
<1> Bind our `ImportantHandler` to `GET /`

[source, groovy]
.Failing test
----
def 'should render \'Very important handler\''() {
  when:
  HandlingResult result = GroovyRequestFixture.handle(new ImportantHandler()) {}

  then:
  result.bodyText == 'Very important handler // <1>
}
----
<1> Consult the `HandlingResult` for response body

WARN: This test will fail

What happened?

`Context#render(Object)` uses Ratpack's rendering framework.
`GroovyRequestFixture` does not actually serialize rendered objects to `Response` of `HandlingResult`.
For this test to pass you must either modify the Handler or modify the expectation:

Modify the handler:

[source, groovy]
.ImportantSendingHandler.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/main/groovy/ImportantSendingHandler.groovy[]
----

Modify the expectation:

[source, groovy]
.ImportantHandlerUnitSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/test/groovy/ImportantHandlerUnitSpec.groovy[tag=rendering-spec]
----
<1> Retrieve the rendered object by type from `HandlingResult`

Everday use:

==== Modify request attributes

[source,groovy]
.HeaderExtractionHandler.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/main/groovy/HeaderExtractionHandler.groovy[]
----
<1> Extract HTTP header and render a response to client


[source,groovy]
.HeaderExtractionHandlingSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/test/groovy/HeaderExtractionHandlingSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> You can get a chance to configure the properties of the request to be made, can configure HTTP method, headers, request body, etc.

==== Modify and make assertions against context registry:

[source, groovy]
.ProfileLoadingHandler.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/main/groovy/ProfileLoadingHandler.groovy[]
----
<1> Extract role from request header, defaulting to 'guest'
<2> Extract a String from the context registry
<3> Delegate to the next Handler in the chain and pass a new single Registry with a newly constructed Profile object

We can make use of `RequestFixture` to populate the Registry with any entries our stand-alone Handler may be expecting, such as a token in the form of a String.

[source, groovy]
.ProfileLoadingHandlingSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/test/groovy/ProfileLoadingHandlingSpec.groovy[tag=registry]
----
<1> Use `RequestFixture#header` to add Headers to the HTTP Request
<2> Use `RequestFixture#registry` to add a `String` to the Context registry
<3> Consult the HandlingResponse to ensure that the context was populated with a `Profile` object and that it meets our expectations


Let's put our `ProfileLoadingHandler` in a chain with a dummy Map renderer:
[source, groovy]
.ProfileLoadingHandlingSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-02/src/test/groovy/ProfileLoadingHandlingSpec.groovy[tag=chain]
----

== `GroovyEmbeddedApp`

`GroovyEmbeddedApp` represents an isolated subset of functionality that stands up a full Ratpack server.

It represents a very bare server that binds to an ephemeral port and has no base directory by default.
`GroovyEmbeddedApp` is also `AutoCloseable`.
If you plan on making more than a few interactions it may help to grab a `TestHttpClient` from the server, otherwise you can make use of `EmbeddedApp#test(TestHttpClient)` which will ensure that the `EmbeddedApp` is shut down gracefully.
Javadocs for Ratpack are 100% tested and make use of `EmbeddedApp` to demonstrate functionality.

The `EmbeddedApp` is also useful in creating a test fixture that represents some network based resource that returns canned or contrived responses.

[source, groovy]
.EmbeddedAppSpec
----
include::../example-03/src/test/groovy/EmbeddedAppSpec.groovy[tag=hello-world]
----
<1> Creates a full Ratpack server with a single handler
<2> Ratpack provides us with a `TestHttpClient` that is configured to submit requests to `EmbeddedApp`. When the closure is finished executing Ratpack will take care of cleaning up the `EmbeddedApp`.

== TestHttpClient

For testing, Ratpack provides `TestHttpClient` which is a blocking, synchronous http client for making requests against a running `ApplicationUnderTest`. This is intentionally designed in order to make testing deterministic and predictable.

[source, groovy]
.EmbeddedAppSpec
----
include::../example-03/src/test/groovy/EmbeddedAppSpec.groovy[tag=client]
----
<1> Create `GroovyEmbeddedApp` from a chain
<2> Retrieve a configured `TestHttpClient` for making requests against the `EmbeddedApp`
<3> Make some assertions about the application as described by the chain
<4> Have Spock invoke `EmbeddedApp#close` to gracefully shutdown the server.

The `TestHttpClient` has some basic support for manipulating request configuration as well as handling redirects and cookies.

[source, groovy]
.EmbeddedAppSpec
----
include::../example-03/src/test/groovy/EmbeddedAppSpec.groovy[tag=request-config]
----
<1> Create sample app that reads and writes cookies
<2> Issue requests that ensures cookie setting/expiring and redirect functionality


== Async Testing

Ratpack is asynchronous and non-blocking from the ground up. This means that not only is Ratpack's api asynchronous but it expects that your code should be asynchronous as well.

Let's say we have a `ProfileService` that's responsible for retrieving `Profile` s:

[source, groovy]
.ProfileService.groovy
----
include::../example-04/src/main/groovy/ProfileService.groovy[]
----

If you were to test this Service without any assistance from Ratpack you will run into the well known `UnmanagedThreadException`:

----
ratpack.exec.UnmanagedThreadException: Operation attempted on non Ratpack managed thread
----

=== ExecHarness

`ExecHarness` is the utility that Ratpack provides to test any kind of asynchronous behavior.
Unsurprisingly `ExecHarness` is also an `AutoCloseable`.
It utilizes resources that manage an `EventLoopGroup` and an `ExecutorService` so it's important to make sure these resources get properly cleaned up.

[source, groovy]
.ProfileServiceExec.groovy
----
include::../example-04/src/test/groovy/ProfileServiceSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> Create an `ExecHarness` and tell Spock to clean up when we are finished
<2> Use `ExecHarness#yield` to wrap all of our service calls so that our Promises and Operations can be resolved on a Ratpack managed thread.

== Functional testing

=== MainClassApplicationUnderTest

`GroovyRatpackMainApplicationUnderTest`::
For testing `ratpack.groovy` backed applications

[source, groovy]
----
include::../example-01/src/test/groovy/HelloWorldSpec.groovy[tag=GroovyScriptAUT]
----

`MainClassApplicationUnderTest`::
For testing class backed applications

[source, groovy]
----
include::../example-01/src/test/groovy/HelloWorldSpec.groovy[tag=MainClassAUT]
----

Our sample Ratpack application for testing:

[source, groovy]
.ratpack.groovy
----
include::../example-05/src/ratpack/ratpack.groovy[]
----
<1> Pull configuration from System properties
<2> Create an ApiConfig object and put into the registry
<3> Bind `ConfService` using Guice
<4> Use `ConfService` to retrieve list of awesome Groovy Conferences

[source, groovy]
.ApiConfig.groovy
----
include::../example-05/src/main/groovy/ApiConfig.groovy[]
----

Simple object to contain our configuration data related to an API

[source, groovy]
.ConfService
----
include::../example-05/src/main/groovy/ConfService.groovy[]
----
<1> Receive `ApiConfig` and `HtpClient` from Guice
<2> Define an asynchronous service method to retrieve data from remote service

=== Configuration

We can take advantage of system properties to change how the Ratpack application configures its services.

[source, groovy]
.FunctionalSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-05/src/test/groovy/FunctionalSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> Create our `ApplicationUnderTest` and tell Spock to clean up when we're done
<2> Retrieve `TestHttpClient` and make use of `@Delegate` to make tests very readable
<3> Create a simple service that response with a comma separated list of Groovy Conferences
<4> Set system property to point to our stubbed service
<5> Write a simple test to assure that our Ratpack app can make a succcessful call to the remote api

=== Impositions

`Impositions` allow a user to provide overrides to various aspects of the Ratpack application bootstrap phase.

* `ServerConfigImposition` allows to override server configuration
* `BindingsImposition` allows to provide Guice binding overrides
* `UserRegistryImposition` allows you to provide alternatives for items in the registry

[source, groovy]
.ImpositionSpec
----
include::../example-05/src/test/groovy/ImpositionSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> Override `addImpositions` method to provide a `UserRegistryImposition` that supplies our own dumb implementation of `ConfService` that does not need to make any network connections

=== RemoteControl

Authored by Luke Daley; originally for Grails

Used to serialize commands to be executed on the `ApplicationUnderTest`

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::../example-06/example-06.gradle[tag=deps]
----
Here we add a test compile dependency on `io.ratpack:ratpack-remote-test` which includes a dependency on `remote-control`

[source, groovy]
.RemoteControlSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-06/src/test/groovy/RemoteControlSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> We use `BindingsImposition` here to add a hook into the running `ApplicationUnderTest` that allows us to run remote code on the server
<2> We tell `RemoteControl` not to complain if the result of the command is not Serializable
<3> We use remote control here to grab the `ProfileService` and manually add a profile

=== EphemeralBaseDir

A utility that provides a nice way to interact with files that would provide the basis of a base directory for Ratpack applications.
It is also an `AutoCloseable` so you'll need to make sure to clean up after use.

[source, groovy]
.EphemeralSpec.groovy
----
include::../example-07/src/test/groovy/EphemeralSpec.groovy[]
----
